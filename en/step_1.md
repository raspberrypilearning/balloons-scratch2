If you need to print this project, please use the [printer-friendly version](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/balloons-scratch2/print){:target="_blank"}.

If children find it difficult to pop balloons without dragging them around, they can play the game in fullscreen mode, in which balloons aren't draggable.
