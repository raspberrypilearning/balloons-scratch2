## Adding a timer

You can make your game more interesting, by only giving your player 10 seconds to pop as many balloons as possible.

--- task ---

You can use another variable to store the remaining time left. Click on the stage, and create a new variable called `time`.

--- /task ---

This is how the timer should work:

+ The timer should start at 10 seconds;
+ The timer should count down every second;
+ The game should stop when the timer gets to 0.

--- task ---

Here's the code to do this, which you can add to your _stage_:

```blocks
when flag clicked
set [time v] to [10]
repeat until <(time) = [0]>
	wait (1) secs
	change [time v] by (-1)
end
stop [all v]
```

--- /task ---

Drag your 'time' variable display to the right side of the stage. You can also right-click on the variable display and choose 'large readout' to change how the time is displayed.

Test your game. How many points can you score? If your game is too easy, you can:

+ Give the player less time;
+ Have more balloons;
+ Make the balloons move faster;
+ Make the balloons smaller.

Play your game a few times until you're happy that it's the right level of difficulty.
